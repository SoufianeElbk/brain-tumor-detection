#Brain Tumor Detection
<p>This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI scans using deep learning. By leveraging a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model classifies MRI images to determine the presence of a tumor. The application can assist medical professionals by providing preliminary tumor assessments to guide further diagnostics.</p>
